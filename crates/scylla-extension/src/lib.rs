//! The action pipeline: every write is a command that moves through typed phases, and an
//! extension attaches to each stage. Depends on the kernel only, so an out-of-tree edition builds
//! against a pinned tag without the access model, the database or the gRPC stack.

/// `no_inline`: rustdoc would otherwise copy the whole model into this crate's docs.
