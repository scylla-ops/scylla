# Scylla

Distributed CI/CD platform.

## Architecture

| Service                | Ports          | Description                                                       |
|------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `scylla-ce`            | `8080`         | One binary: web UI, gRPC API, gRPC-Web, webhook ingress, and in-process job dispatch |
| `scylla-agent`         | —              | Worker installed per machine; registered as an "App" in the UI, run out-of-band |
| `postgres`             | `5432`         | Primary datastore (PostgreSQL 18)                                 |

Two binaries ship: `scylla-ce` (the control plane, Community Edition) and `scylla-agent` (remote workers). Agents connect to the control plane over a persistent worker stream, there is no message broker.

Everything the browser and the agents talk to lives on **one port**. The control plane serves the compiled-in web UI, terminates gRPC-Web for the browser, speaks native gRPC to the agents, and accepts inbound webhooks at `/webhooks/{trigger_id}` — all on `8080`. Because the UI is served from the same origin as the API, the bundle uses relative URLs: the published image carries no baked-in hostname and works unchanged in any deployment.

The workspace is a stack of library crates under `crates/` with the two binaries under `binaries/`: `scylla-ce` (the control plane) and `scylla-agent` (the worker). See [Workspace layout](#workspace-layout) below.

## Workspace layout

```
crates/
  scylla-extension/   the edition boundary: the action pipeline every write goes through (depends on scylla-domain only)
  scylla-domain/      the shared kernel: domain model, JobEvent (no I/O, no crypto)
  scylla-proto/       the wire contract: .proto files + generated bindings (also consumed by the frontend)
  scylla-auth/        the access model: RBAC ports and types, the Cedar adapter
  scylla-core/        use cases and their ports, gRPC + HTTP surfaces, server config, in-memory adapters
  scylla-db/          the Postgres adapters, the pool, the embedded migrations
  scylla-server/      the composition root: the Server builder and the shared cli
binaries/
  scylla-ce/          the Community Edition binary: a main.rs and config/*.toml
  scylla-agent/       the worker binary (depends on scylla-domain + scylla-proto only)
apps/frontend/        the web UI, compiled into scylla-ce through scylla-core
migrations/           the SQL schema, embedded by scylla-db
```

Dependencies point one way, bottom to top:

```
scylla-domain <- scylla-proto     <- scylla-core <- scylla-db <- scylla-server <- scylla-ce
scylla-domain <- scylla-auth      <- scylla-core
scylla-domain <- scylla-extension <- scylla-core
```

`scylla-core` holds the ports declared in `scylla-core` and `scylla-auth` as trait objects (`Arc<dyn Port>`); `scylla-db` implements them; `scylla-server` is the only crate that names the concrete implementations side by side. The binaries are a `main.rs` each: parse the command line, load the configuration, open the pool with `scylla_db::init_db`, then `Server::new(config, db)`, the edition's contributions as builder methods, `serve()`.

A WebAssembly plugin runtime is planned as `crates/scylla-wasm/`; it does not exist yet.

## Editions and the extension mechanism

This repository is the open source core and ships the Community Edition binary, `scylla-ce`. A separate, private repository builds an Enterprise binary on top of it. The dependency is strictly one way: the private repository depends on this one by a pinned git tag, and nothing here knows it exists.

The seam between the two is `crates/scylla-extension`, the action pipeline. Every write in the core is a command (`CreateProject { organization_id, name, description }`) that `Actions::run` moves through three typed stages: `Authorize` (the access check, run by the core for every action: the action declares `Access::Public`, `Access::Authenticated` or the permissions it requires), `Prepare` (the use case reads and builds a staged value, it does not write) and `Persist` (the store writes inside `Prepared::commit`). Every read is a query (`GetProject { id }`) that the same `Actions::run` moves through `Authorize` and `Fetch`; the trait the action implements (`Command` or `Query`) decides what follows the access check. Around each stage the `Hooks` registry runs six positions, in this order:

```
Policy -> Gate<S> -> Around [ Wrap<S> [ Run ] ] -> Listener<S> -> Observer
 veto      veto      control   control            side effect     record
 every     one       every     one                one             every
```

`Policy`, `Around` and `Observer` are erased: registered on a stage kind, they fire for every command, including commands that do not exist yet, and see the caller, the `Permission` and the action id. `Gate<S>`, `Wrap<S>` and `Listener<S>` are typed: registered on one stage of one command, they see the exact phase. A veto is a `DomainError` (`quota_exceeded`, `business_rule`) and maps to gRPC like any other. The crate depends on `scylla-domain` and nothing else, so an edition builds against a pinned git tag without the access model, the database or the gRPC stack.

An edition bundles its hooks in a type that implements `Extension` and registers it once:

```rust
impl Extension for MeteredQuota {
    fn register(self: &Arc<Self>, hooks: &mut Hooks) {
        hooks
            .policy(StageKind::Prepare, self.clone())   // veto a create over the plan's limit
            .observe(StageKind::Persist, self.clone()); // count what was stored
    }
}

Server::new(config, db).extension(&Arc::new(MeteredQuota::new(plans))).serve()
```

The Community Edition registers nothing: the pipeline runs the access check, the stages and no hook. A use case is a struct that holds its ports and implements `Run<Prepare<C>>` and `Run<Persist<C>>` per command (`commands.rs`) and `Run<Fetch<Q>>` per query (`queries.rs`), one block per action; it has no method of its own. The gRPC handler is the adapter: each RPC is one `grpc::adapter::run` call, which parses the request into its command or query (`grpc::convert::Parse`, implemented in the aggregate's mapper), runs the engine and maps the error. The project use case and its handler are the reference; see `crates/scylla-extension/AGENTS.md` for the positions, the decision table and the failure semantics.

The same builder takes what else an edition contributes, usually bundled as a `scylla_server::Feature` (its hooks, its migrations on the shared pool, its services): `authenticated_grpc_service` / `grpc_service` (its own gRPC services on the same listener, behind the core's bearer-token interceptor or not), `file_descriptor_set` (so reflection lists them) and `http_routes`. A feature's `install` step receives a `Context` with the pool and the core's authorization ports, so its use cases enforce the same policies as the core's. A private edition therefore adds whole features without touching this repository.

## Prerequisites

You only need Docker. Everything else (Rust, Node.js, pnpm) runs inside containers.

- **Docker** (>= 24) with **Docker Compose** v2
- **[just](https://github.com/casey/just)** (optional, shortcuts for `docker compose`)

Check versions:

```sh
docker --version
docker compose version
```

## Quick start

Prebuilt images are published for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` — Docker pulls the right one for your host automatically.

One command pulls the prebuilt images and starts the stack (control plane, PostgreSQL). Agents are added afterward from the UI — see below:

> [!WARNING]
> Coming from an earlier beta? Wipe the previous stack first with `just clean` — it removes the old containers, volumes, and locally-built images, which are not compatible across betas. This release also drops the separate `scylla-frontend` service, and `docker compose down` alone would leave it behind as an orphan.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scylla-ops/scylla.git
cd scylla
just up
# or, without just:
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

First boot creates the `admin` user automatically.

Open **http://localhost:8080/** and sign in:

- username: `admin`
- password: `admin123`

## Developing

The stack above is enough to run Scylla. To work on it:

```sh
just db-up                                        # Postgres alone
cargo run -p scylla-ce -- \
    --config binaries/scylla-ce/config/local.toml --no-ui
cd apps/frontend && pnpm install && pnpm dev       # http://localhost:5173
```

`--no-ui` is what makes this work: the web UI is compiled into the release
binary, and in dev there is nothing to compile in — Vite owns it on `:5173`.
The flag drops the UI routes entirely so the binary serves only the API.
(`config/local.toml` already sets `[ui].enabled = false`, so the flag is
belt-and-braces.) `apps/frontend/.env` points the dev bundle at `:8080`;
`local.toml` allows that origin through CORS.

To run the real thing natively, build the UI first — a release `cargo build`
embeds whatever is in `apps/frontend/dist`:

```sh
just ui-build
cargo build --release -p scylla-ce
```

## TLS

The control plane speaks plain HTTP by default, on the assumption that a reverse
proxy or ingress terminates TLS in front of it. To terminate it in the binary
instead, point `[server.tls]` at a PEM chain and key:

```toml
[server]
address = "0.0.0.0:8443"

[server.tls]
cert = "/etc/scylla/tls/fullchain.pem"
key  = "/etc/scylla/tls/privkey.pem"
```

Both HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 are advertised over ALPN, so browsers, gRPC clients and
plain HTTP/1.1 webhook senders all connect to the same socket.

## Common commands

| `just`        | `docker compose`                  | What it does                                  |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `just up`     | `docker compose pull && up -d`    | Pull and start (or refresh) the beta stack    |
| `just down`   | `docker compose down`             | Stop the stack                                |
| `just clean`  | `docker compose down -v --rmi local --remove-orphans` | Stop and wipe volumes + local images |
| `just logs [svc]` | `docker compose logs -f [svc]` | Follow logs (all services or one)            |
| `just status` | `docker compose ps`               | Show running containers                       |

Run `just --list` to see every recipe.

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use.** Another process holds `8080` or `5432`. Stop it or change the host port in `docker-compose.yaml`.

**`scylla-ce` fails to connect to PostgreSQL.** Ensure `postgres` is `healthy` via `just status` (or `docker compose ps`). If it's stuck, run `just clean` to reset the volume and try again.

**Frontend shows gRPC errors.** The UI and the API share an origin, so there is no CORS step to get wrong; check that `scylla-ce` is `healthy` (`just status`) and read its logs. `curl http://localhost:8080/healthz` should answer `ok`.

**Agent not picking up jobs.** Agents run out-of-band (not in this compose stack). Check the agent's own logs and confirm it can reach the control plane at its `--control-plane-url` with a valid `--app-id` / `--app-secret`. In the UI the app shows as connected once its worker stream is open.

## Optional: local development

The Docker workflow above is self-contained — **Node.js and Rust are not required** to run Scylla. The sections below are only for contributors who want to iterate on the frontend or crates outside Docker.

### Frontend (Vite dev server on `:5173`)

Requires Node.js >= 20 and pnpm >= 9 (`corepack enable`). See [apps/frontend/README.md](apps/frontend/README.md) for setup.

### Building crates locally

Requires the Rust toolchain. Standard Cargo workflow:

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
```

To build the Docker images from source instead of pulling them:

```sh
just local
```
